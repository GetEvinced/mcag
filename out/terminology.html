This text alternative intends to offer an equivalent understanding of the image's information without overwhelming the user with excessive details.</p><h4>Decorative</h4><p>Decorative images refer to images that serve a solely aesthetic or decorative purpose, providing no significant content or information relevant to understanding the app's functionality or content. Text alternatives for decorative images are typically left empty or use a null value, indicating to assistive technologies that the image is purely decorative and does not convey any meaningful information necessary for understanding the app's content or functionality. This approach helps screen readers focus on essential content without disrupting the user experience with irrelevant descriptions for purely ornamental visuals.</p><h4>Functional</h4><p>Functional images refer to images that represent controls, links, or buttons essential for users to interact with the app's functionality. Text alternatives for functional images should convey the function or purpose of the control, aiding users who rely on screen readers or assistive technologies to understand the interactive nature of the image. This alt text should succinctly describe the action or outcome triggered by interacting with the image, ensuring users comprehend its role in the app's functionality. Providing accurate text alternatives for functional images is crucial for users who rely on assistive technologies to navigate and interact effectively within the mobile application.</p><h4>Informative</h4><p>Informative images are images that convey essential information, context, or conveyance of function within the app's interface. Text alternatives for informative images are descriptive text alternatives that succinctly describe the content or message conveyed by the image, aiding users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies to understand the significance of the visual element.

Platforms have specific attributes for these roles so that assistive technologies interpret the component correctly.</p><p>The component’s role is separate from its accessible name. A component’s role is not added to the accessible name because assistive technologies may not correctly identify it for users.</p><p>Web and native app platforms usually have a dedicated attribute when defining custom roles or types. Custom roles typically use familiar and unambiguous terms that reflect the nature of the component and how it is used.
