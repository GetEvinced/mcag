The document results from cross-referencing WCAG 2.2 success criteria with the accessibility guidelines of the different platforms and other sources.<br/>MCAG was written into the template and structure of WCAG, and it preserves the four <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/">POUR</a>. However, since its use is intended for development teams, its internal division relies more on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility">Apple&#x27;s Human Interface Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility">Android&#x27;s Accessibility Principles</a>. Accordingly, the guidelines&#x27; names, divisions, and success criteria are different. The differences are reflected mainly in wording and affiliation. However, any changes were made with reference and an affinity to WCAG and its content.<br/>MCAG does not pretend to replace WCAG but only provides a uniform interpretation of it for mobile technologies while preserving its conformance requirements.</p><p>The document in front of you is a first draft and an invitation to cooperation and community discussion on the need for clear and dedicated guidelines for mobile technologies that will meet the needs of users and regulatory requirements.</p><p>Consider as a proposal for uniform guidelines for the accessibility of native mobile apps that will not necessarily depend on the platform or the application&#x27;s underlying technology.<br/>The MCAG is formed inspired by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and it is based on it while striving to fill the gaps in the WCAG regarding mobile apps, specifically native apps, and to make the necessary adjustments to emphasize the challenges and accessibility issues typical on mobile applications.<br/>See the <a href="https://github.com/GetEvinced/mcag">GitHub repository</a></p><h2>The motivation behind this initiative</h2><p>This initiative had several motives. It started as an internal experiment within Evinced to map how the WCAG applies to native mobile applications, firstly to improve our own tests; and secondly as an answer to customers and prospects whose apps are mandated for compliance, and who wanted to know what level of coverage they would receive and what gaps would remain for manual testers.</p><p>One of the results of this experiment was the realization that it is impossible to benchmark the accessibility of mobile apps to WCAG without also ignoring vendors&#x27; accessibility guidelines, even if they are not as comprehensive as WCAG and sometimes also coincide with it; they do contain specific references to mobile technologies and some of their accessibility challenges which naturally are not reflected in WCAG. With this understanding, the initial idea was formed to produce tailored guidelines for mobile applications based on cross-referencing information from several sources.<br/>Therefore, with the understanding and belief that we are not the only ones who face the challenges and questions that arise in the context of how WCAG applies to native mobile applications, and the recognition that in order to establish significant and sustainable guidelines that develop and update with the technology, we decided to publish this first draft as a proposal for a starting point of a discussion and with the aim companies and community members who see value in such guidelines will join and contributed their knowledge and experience in the development of the initiative. The first goal is to provide guidelines mapped to WCAG that will allow easy analysis of the level of compliance of mobile apps with WCAG and hopefully will later be adopted as a separate and dedicated standard.</p><h2>Do we really need another set of accessibility guidelines?</h2><h3>WCAG is designed for web technologies and practices</h3><p>WCAG has been adopted as the primary benchmark for digital accessibility by regulators, and rightly so. Even if it is imperfect, the WCAG is detailed and comprehensive, its success criteria were discussed and tested comprehensively, and most importantly, it provides a set of testable requirements and a ranking method to determine the accessibility level of web-based pages.</p><p>Because of the advantages mentioned above, the inherent similarities between web and mobile technologies in terms of display and consumption of information and user input, and the fact that many of the WCAG success criteria deal with common accessibility issues in mobile apps and digital media in general, and not necessarily unique to web technologies it has naturally been adopted as the benchmark for the accessibility of mobile apps as well.</p><p>For example, this trend can be seen in the European standard (<a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf">EN 301 549</a>) in chapter 11, which deals with software and mobile applications directly referring to WCAG 2.1 AA. A similar reference can also be seen in the reports of products for accessibility testing (due disclosure also those of Evinced) and the need and strive of the app owners to confirm a standard according to which they know that their products are sufficiently accessible and meet the requirements that will protect them from lawsuits. However, in all of these cases, it can be seen that the conformity of WCAG to mobile app accessibility requirements is not complete; not all WCAG success criteria are mapped to mobile equivalents, and there are issues specific to mobile that WCAG does not cover, such as content grouping and some of its success criteria are phrased in direct reference to the web technologies and an interpretation is required to adapt them to mobile as for example in 1.4.10 Reflow or 1.4 .12 Text Spacing. The WCAG naturally refers widely to the keyboard since it is the most essential assistance technology for the web. On the other hand, it is less prevalent in mobile while supporting standard accessibility features of mobile devices is not considered or addressed.</p><p>For the question of whether it expected to see more criteria referencing issues typical to mobile apps in WCAG 3 (in the first announcements on WCAG 3, there was a statement of intent that it would be suitable for digital media in general), the answer was that despite the initial intention it was decided in the W3C that since the <b>W</b> in the acronym stands for &quot;<b>web</b>,&quot; the WAI will continue focusing exclusively on web technologies. Hence, the inherent gaps in WCAG about mobile applications will remain. These circumstances leave gray areas and room for interpretation regarding the accessibility requirements that will fit the technology and potential issues that are typical to the technology not addressed.</p><h3>Don&#x27;t mobile accessibility guidelines already exist?</h3><p>Suppose one is Googling &quot;accessibility guidelines for mobile apps&quot; or, even more specifically, for iOS or Android apps. In that case, they will get many results ranging from vendor guidelines such as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility">Apple&#x27;s Human Interface Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/accessibility/">developer documentation&#x27;s</a> accessibility chapters or the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/principles">Android Accessibility Principles</a> to guidelines written by accessibility professionals like <a href="https://www.accessibilityoz.com/resources/mobile-testing/">AccessibilityOZ</a>, which focus on testing methodologies and checklists. The <a href="https://www.funka.com/en/research-and-innovation/archive---research-projects/mobile-guidelines/">Funka Nu organization</a> also published accessibility guidelines for mobile apps. However, the phrasing of these guidelines is at a relatively general level. It does not go down to the details of testable, measurable use cases that allow presenting a uniform standardization.</p><p>WAI also attempted to map WCAG 2.1 to meet the specific requirements for mobile web written by the WAI&#x27;s <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/">Mobile Accessibility Task Force</a>. They published the first public working draft of &quot;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/">Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines Apply to Mobile</a>&quot; in February 2015 and an <a href="https://w3c.github.io/Mobile-A11y-TF-Note/">editor&#x27;s draft</a> in December 2018; however, there have been no other updates since then, and it seems like the project was abandoned; in any case, this mapping was designed for mobile web and not for native apps so it is not impossible that some of the gaps would still have remained and that some issues would potentially still stay unaddressed.</p><p>However, this knowledge and ideas have never been distilled to a uniform standard that is required given the place that mobile has occupied in our lives and the specific accessibility challenges of the technology.</p><p>Hence, the primary objective of this MCAG draft is to cross-reference principles and concepts from the sources mentioned above and others and map them to testable use cases similar to WCAG.</p><h2>The writing process of this draft</h2><p>The writing process of this draft began in a thinking group participated by product managers, mobile developers and architects, designers, researchers, and accessibility professionals. The objective of this thinking group was to map which WCAG success criteria are valid for mobile applications, where for each success criterion, it was indicated whether it applies to mobile as it is phrased or only in spirit; that is, that its fundamental essence suitable for mobile, however, a particular interpretation is required for it to suit the accessibility challenges typical to mobile.</p><p>The second stage was cross-referencing WCAG&#x27;s success criteria with the vendors&#x27; guidelines and documentation (i.e., iOS and Android), which helped to distill the common and clarify what adjustments are required to start accurate success criteria.<br/>The third stage was cross-referencing all the guidelines with various other sources (the primary list of sources later). In parallel and with the understandings that have been formulated, several outline versions were experimented with until they were crystallized into the draft proposed here.</p><h2>Target audience and personas</h2><p>We believe that the key to the development of accessible products is understanding both the accessibility challenges and the requirements of all those in positions throughout the product&#x27;s life cycle. This draft was written to be readable and transparent primarily to the members of the research and development teams, starting with the product manager through the UI/UX designers and developers to QA testers. Secondarily, this guideline is intended to be used by by accessibility professionals.</p><p>This text is intended for a technical audience, but also to be relatively easy to read for a general audience.</p><p>We have defined four personas that we believe are MCAG&#x27;s primary target audienceof software development teams:</p><h3>The personas</h3><section><h4>Product Manager</h4><p><b>Name:</b> Alex Morgan</p><p><b>Role: </b>Product Manager - Native Mobile App (iOS and Android)</p><b>Background:</b><br/><ul><li>Alex has five years of experience in product management, specializing in mobile applications.</li><li>Proficient in agile methodologies, Alex has successfully launched several mobile apps across different platforms.</li><li>Holds a strong understanding of user experience (UX) design principles and product development processes.</li><li>Committed to ensuring the app&#x27;s success by meeting not only business goals but also user needs and regulatory requirements.</li></ul><b>Responsibilities:</b><br/><ul><li>Oversees the development and enhancement of a native mobile application available on both iOS and Android platforms.</li><li>Collaborates with cross-functional teams, including developers, designers, and QA, to plan and prioritize features, enhancements, and bug fixes.</li><li>Works closely with stakeholders to define and achieve business objectives while meeting user requirements.</li><li>Responsible for ensuring the app meets accessibility standards and regulations.</li></ul><b>Goals and Challenges:</b><br/><ul><li>Ensure the app&#x27;s features are seamlessly implemented across both iOS and Android platforms while maintaining consistency and optimal user experience.</li><li>Strive to enhance the app&#x27;s accessibility, ensuring it complies with WCAG and platform-specific accessibility standards.</li><li>Manage the product roadmap, balancing business objectives with user needs and accessibility compliance.</li></ul><b>Needs and Preferences:</b><br/><ul><li>Requires clear communication and collaboration among teams to ensure the app&#x27;s accessibility features are well-integrated without compromising the app&#x27;s functionality or design.</li><li>Prefers data-driven decisions, relying on analytics and user feedback to drive product enhancements.</li><li>Seeks to leverage tools and resources to streamline accessibility testing and compliance efforts.</li></ul><b>Key Quote:</b><p>&quot;I am dedicated to ensuring our mobile app delivers an inclusive experience for all users.
